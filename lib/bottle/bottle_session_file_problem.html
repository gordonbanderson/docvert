<h1>Session file problem</h1>
<p>Please tell the administrator of this Docvert web service that there seems to be a file permissions problem with Bottle's session storage.</p>
<p>Tell them that docvert-web.py should have printed a stacktrace of the error, and that on Linux the session files are usually in /tmp/docvert-session-* . Usually these files just need to be deleted.</p>
<p>With this information they'll hopefully be able to fix it -- fingers crossed!</p>
